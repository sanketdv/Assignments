#### Python Assignment to learn basics and various methods used while programming
#### Methods used:
- Variable Args
    - *args: Used to pass a variable number of non-keyword arguments to a function. These arguments are collected into a tuple within the function.

- Keyword Args
    - **kwargs: Used to pass a variable number of keyword arguments to a function. These arguments are collected into a dictionary within the function.
      
- List Comprehension
    - List comprehension in Python offers a concise way to create new lists based on existing iterables. It provides a more readable and efficient alternative to traditional loops for list creation.

- String Formatter
    - String formatting in Python allows for the insertion of variables and expressions into strings. There are several methods to achieve this:
        1. f-string
        2. str.format()
        3. % operator
           
- Dunder Methods
    - Also known as magic methods, are special methods in Python that begin and end with double underscores
    - Common Dunder Methods
        1. __init__(self, ...): Constructor method for initializing objects.
        2.  __str__(self): Returns a string representation of the object.
        3.  __repr__(self): Returns a printable representation of the object.
        4.  __len__(self): Returns the length of the object.
        5.  __getitem__(self, key): Enables indexing and accessing elements.
        6.  __setitem__(self, key, value): Enables assignment to indexed elements.
        7.  __delitem__(self, key): Enables deletion of indexed elements.
        8.  __eq__(self, other): Defines equality comparison.
        9.  __ne__(self, other): Defines inequality comparison.
        10.  __lt__(self, other): Defines less-than comparison.
        11.  __gt__(self, other): Defines greater-than comparison.
        12.  __le__(self, other): Defines less-than-or-equal-to comparison.
        13.  __ge__(self, other): Defines greater-than-or-equal-to comparison.
        14.  __add__(self, other): Defines addition.
        15.  __sub__(self, other): Defines subtraction.
        16.  __mul__(self, other): Defines multiplication.
        17.  __truediv__(self, other): Defines true division.
     
- Decorators
  `- A decorator is a design pattern in Python that allows a user to add new functionality to an existing object without modifying its structure.
